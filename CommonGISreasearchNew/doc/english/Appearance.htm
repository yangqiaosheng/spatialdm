	 <P>The main window of the program is divided into a menu bar, where the
		commands are, a tool bar and the map window. </P> 
	 <P>A map window contains two subwindows one with the map and one where the
		map legend and the manipulation tags appear. <BR>The legend (see image 1) shows
		the layers the map consists of, the status (drawn or hidden) of each layer, the
		visual properties such as color or line thickness, the order of the layers in
		the map, the status of the Labels, and the active layer. The active layer is
		the layer whose objects react to mouse events, such as, pointing on an object
		with the mouse cursor or clicking on an object. </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Legend.gif" WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="126"
		BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 1:<BR>An example map legend.</P> 
	 <P>For each map layer there is an item in the legend that consists of the
		following elements: <BR>&middot; "Plus" or "minus" icon indicating whether the
		layer is drawn or not. The icon is sensitive to mouse clicks. Upon a mouse
		click the icon is changed to the opposite (that is, plus to minus and vice
		versa), and so does the drawing status of the layer. <BR>&middot; An image
		representing the type of the objects in the layer (point, line, or area) and
		their current visual properties. For example, in figure 1 the layer "Cities"
		consists of point objects, the layer "Roads" - of linear objects, and the layer
		"Counties" - of areal objects.<BR>&middot; In a small box next to the image an
		"L" indicates an active labeling. The identifier of the object is depicted in
		the center of the corresponding area on the map, depending whether it fits in
		it or not (as shown in figure 2).<BR> &middot; The name of the layer. </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Labels.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="499"

	 <P>When visualization of thematic data is added to a map, the legend item
		of the corresponding map layer is extended to include the explanation of the
		symbols used for the visualisation. </P> 
	 <P>Through the legend it is possible to do following interactive
		operations: </P>

	 <P>The little button with the ? in the upper right corner gives help on the
		legend in an browser window.</P> 
	 <P>The map itself is surrounded by little black triangles: on every corner
		and in the middle of every side. They cause a moving of the map display in the

		effects are.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ToolBar.gif" WIDTH="242" HEIGHT="31"

	 <P>The first 4 buttons are used for map zooming. First one makes the map
		fit in the window. The next two zoom in and out. And the last one undoes the
		last zooming action.<BR>The button in the middle is for printing. A window pops
		up with special options for the printer.<BR>The three buttons on the right
		indicate the mouse options. The left one makes a rectangle when dragging across
		the map and zooms in this part. The one in the middle makes a straight line
		when the cursor is being dragged. The map moves as if it is pushed in the
		direction the line was dragged and as far as the line long was. When the right
		button is checked, objects on the map can be selected by dragging. The objects
		in the box shown while dragging are added to the selected ones (black outline).
		When selected objects are selected again, the activation is removed. All
		selection can also be removed by clicking on an object free area.</P>

		STYLE="font-weight: bold; font-size: large; text-decoration: underline">General
		interface features:</A></P> 
	 <P>The Descartes system supports two kinds of highlighting: transient and
		durable. Transient ("mouse-over") highlighting occurs when the mouse cursor is
		positioned over an object and is switched off immediately after the mouse is
		moved aside. Durable highlighting occurs when an object is selected by clicking
		or dragging the mouse and lasts until the user explicitly cancels it. Click on
		a durably highlighted object cancels its highlighting. Click in an object-free
		area of any display cancels highlighting of all objects. Descartes uses white
		color for transient highlighting and black for durable highlighting.</P> 
	 <P>When "drag to reorder" is written under a list, then it is possible to
		change the order by dragging one item to the wished position (a little arrow
		appears).</P> 
	 <P>A split panel has little black arrows indicating that it is possible to
		maximize the subwindow in the direction it is pointing (see Figure 4). The hole
		segment can be dragged to make a subwindow smaller or bigger.</P>

	 <P>The record options (Headline: Options -&gt; Show record options) change
		the modes and properties of showing attribute values when touching an object
		with the mouse (figure 5). When "Enable record display in popup window" is
		active, then a window next to the mouse pointer appears with the name of the
		object pointed at and the values of the visualized attributes. The number of
		lines can be limited. </P>

		selected objects. How many and which attributes are shown can be set in the
		record option window (all or only selected ones, etc.)</P>
