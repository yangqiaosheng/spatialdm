		and ratios:</A></P> 
	 <P>To calculate the percentage of one attribute according to another check
		the "% in"- button and select an attribute from the list beneath it. <BR>When
		more than one attribute was selected before (otherwise it would not make sense)
		and the button "their sum" is activated, Descartes creates the sum of all
		selected attributes and calculates the percentage of each attribute to it (one
		attribut &lt;-&gt; sum).<BR>And when "number:" is activated Descartes
		calculates the percentage of the attribute(s) to the number entered.<BR>The
		ratio is calculated when "divided by" is checked. The different methods are the
		same as if the percentage is being calculated. <BR>Note: The attribute which is
		supposed to represent the whole can not be taken from the list of selected
		ones.</P>

	 <P>From 2 attributes Descartes can calculate the change, ratio and
		difference. It leaves the opportunity to choose between "A-B", "A/B", "A%B" ,
		"(A-B)/B" and "(A-B)%B", where a%b gives the remainder of dividing two numbers
		a and b.<BR>Press "Invert A and B" to switch the roles of A and B.</P>
