<h3>
<a NAME="RD1" STYLE="font-size: large; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline"></a>How
to run Descartes:</h3>

<p><br>Descartes is a Java application and needs Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) (at least Version 1.1) to run. The latest version (currently Java
2 Runtime Environment 1.3) can be downloaded for free at: <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/index.html">http://java.sun.com/products/j2se/1.3/jre</a>
<p>Descartes can be activated with a *.bat file that looks like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC" >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>d:\jdk122\bin\java -classpath CommonGIS.jar;d:\jdk122\lib\rt.jar
esda_main.RunDescartes</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>&nbsp;
<table WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>d:\jdk122\bin\java</td>

<td>The path to the Java interpreter (may be different on your computer)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-classpath</td>

<td>A keyword indicating for the Java interpreter that the list of classes
to load follows</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CommonGIS.jar</td>

<td>An archive with classes of Descartes (CommonGIS); may have a different
name</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>d:\jdk122\lib\rt.jar</td>

<td>The library of standard Java classes corresponding to the version of
Java interpreter used</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>esda_main.RunDescartes</td>

<td>The main class of Descartes (CommonGIS) that starts the work of the
system</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When this file is launched a Dos-Prompt is started and Descartes is
started with a blank window.
<p>First thing to do is to load the data you want to work with.
<br>This is done with File ->Load data or <a href="#applications">File
->Load application</a>

<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="RD2" STYLE="font-size: large; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline"></a>Data
format:</h3>

<p><br>Descartes can work with different formates of data:
<ul>
<li>
files:</li>

<ul>
<li>
thematic data: DBF (dBase), ASCII with delimiters, in particular, CSV -
comma-separated values (Excel)</li>

<li>
vector geographic data: GML (OpenGIS), WKB (OpenGIS), Shape (ArcGIS), MIF/MID
(MapInfo)</li>

<li>
raster geographic data: ADF and BIL (ArcGIS)</li>

<li>
geo-referenced images: GIF, JPEG, TIFF</li>
</ul>

<li>
clipboard: Excel, WinWord (thematic data)</li>

<li>
database: ODBC (thematic data), Oracle (thematic and vector geographic
data)</li>
</ul>
Besides, Descartes works with its own OVL format for vector data that is
optimized for smaller file sizes and, hence, faster transmission over the
Internet.
<p>In order to load data from a file in text format, the system needs some
additional information:
<br>It needs to know how the values are separated are (preselected), the
name or number of the field with identifiers (necessary), where the names
of entities are and where in the text the field types and the field names
are found (optional).
<center>
<p><img SRC="LoadFromFile.gif" BORDER=0 height=400 width=400 align=CENTER>
<br>Figure 1
<br>Loading data from text format</center>

<p>In this example the field names are to be found in line 1, the Values
are separated by "," and the Identifiers are in field 1.
<p>The bottom line of the map window shows whether the table (layer) was
loaded correctly or not:

<p><img SRC="MapImplementation.gif" BORDER=0 height=499 width=640 align=CENTER>
<br>Figure 2
<br>Portugal data implemented</center>

<p>The geographic data can either be added layer by layer and their parameters
selected by hand, or they have been already put together in an *.app file
(by previous saving).
<p><a href="#RD0">Goto beginning</a>
<h3>
<a NAME="applications"></a>Applications</h3>
DescartesXXI (CommonGIS) can load geographic and thematic data according
to a specification given in a special ASCII file having the extension <b>*.app</b>.
For downward compatibility, DescartesXXI can also deal with <b>*.mwi</b>
files, the map configuration files of the earlier versions of the Descartes
system (the older format was suited only for geographic data). Creation
of such a specification file can be considered as defining some Descartes
application; therefore we shall further call them application files.
<p>The Descartes system may be started with giving the path to an application
file as an argument, for example:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC" >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>d:\jdk122\bin\java -classpath CommonGIS.jar;d:\jdk122\lib\rt.jar
esda_main.RunDescartes data\wallis\wallis.app</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In this case the system will immediately load the data specified in
the application file after its start. Otherwise, an application can be
loaded using the command “Load application” of the menu “File” (this works
only in a local variant of the system).
<p>An application file lists map layers and tables to be loaded and provides
important information for loading such as the data source or the table
column with object identifiers. An application file also specifies layer
properties such as color or line thickness.
<p>There is no need to describe the internal syntax of the application
specification language because Descartes applications can be built interactively.
For this purpose a user starts the local version of the system, loads into
the system one by one the necessary layers and tables, defines the appearance
of the layers on the map and decides which layers must be loaded at start-up
time and which will wait until the user explicitly selects them (such layers
must be “switched off” but not removed!). After that the user selects the
command “Save application” in the “File” menu, and the system will automatically
write the corresponding application description in a user-specified file.
Next time when starting the system the user can load the so created application.
<p>It should be noted that, when dealing with applications, Descartes applies,
whenever possible, so-called delayed data loading. This means that geographic
data for a layer that is initially switched off will not be loaded until
the user explicitly switches the layer on. Similarly, thematic data are
not loaded until the user first addresses a table, for example, wishes
to view this table or visualize attributes from it. However, if data for
a table are stored together with geographic data for some layer (i.e. in
the same data source), and this layer is initially switched on, the table
will be loaded simultaneously with loading the layer.

<a NAME="RD3" STYLE="font-size: large; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline"></a>First
start:</h3>
To visualize a selection of data, click on "Display", then "Display Wizard".
In response, a window for choosing the attributes appears. Descartes has
different visualization methods depending on the number of attributes and
their values:
<br>For maps: Degrees of darkness, classification, standalone bars, colors,
parallel bars, pies, triangles, utility bars and utility wheels.
<br>For charts: dot plot (horizontal), dot plot (vertical), scatter plot,
scatter plot matrix, parallel coordinates plot, classifier (horizontal)
and classifier (vertical).
<p>Figure 3 shows the window where the visualization method can be chosen
from.

<h3>
<a NAME="linking"></a>Multiple data displays and their linking</h3>
In Descartes it is possible to build multiple displays representing different
attributes of the same data set or, possibly, the same attributes in different
ways. Thus, the user can open one or more maps and various kinds of non-cartographic
displays: dot plots, scatter plots, parallel coordinate plots. All these
displays are dynamically linked. Thus, when the user points with the mouse
on an object in one of the displays, the graphical elements corresponding
to this object (contour in a map, dot in a dot plot or a scatter plot,
line in a parallel coordinate plot) are simultaneously highlighted in all
the displays.
<p>Descartes supports two kinds of highlighting: transient and durable.
Transient ("mouse-over") highlighting occurs when the mouse cursor is positioned
over an object and is switched off immediately after the mouse is moved
aside. Durable highlighting occurs when an object is selected by clicking
or dragging the mouse and lasts until the user explicitly cancels it. Click
on a durably highlighted object cancels its highlighting. Click in an object-free
area of any display cancels highlighting of all objects. Descartes uses
white color for transient highlighting and black for durable highlighting.
<p>Selection by mouse dragging is automatically enabled in all noncartographic
displays. In a map window mouse dragging can be used as well for zooming
and shifting of the viewport. The user can switch between different interpretations
of mouse dragging using button switches in the tool bar of the map window.
<br>In a map with several layers only objects of the active layer can be
affected by highlighting. To make a layer active, the user should click
on it in the legend. When the active layer changes, highlighting of objects
from the previously active layer is cancelled. It will appear again when
this layer is activated once more.
