		query</A></P> 
	 <P>A useful tool for decision making is "dynamic query". With this tool one
		can interactively set and dynamically alter constraints on attribute values. In
		response to the manipulations all the displays of the system are immediately
		redrawn to show only objects satisfying the constraints. A decision maker can
		impose constraints not only on source attributes but also on results of
		computation.</P> 
	 <P>The displayed statistics, which can be turned on and off, give an
		overview on how many objects fulfil the respective constraints set. The last
		bar on the right shows how many objects fulfil all constraints. <BR>When some
		objects have no value assigned they can be excluded from the resulting objects
		by activating the check box "Filter out missing values" on the lower left
		corner. They do not appear in the last statistic bar.</P> 
	 <P>The constraints given in figure 1 are:<BR>1) at least 5 lifts,<BR>2) the
		highest price for 6 days of skiing is to be 220,<BR>3) a length of 50 for ski
		runs, and<BR>4) at least 20% of expert level runs.</P>

	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, applying "dynamic query" to the ranking of options
		according to the aggregated scores, one can make all displays show only a
		selected number of top-scoring options. When the decision maker alters the
		weights of the criteria, the system recomputes the scores and the ranking,
		applies the constraints to the new results obtained, and makes the map and
		other displays show the new set of best options.</P>

		objects</A></P> 
	 <P>This tool helps to select several objects from several layers in the
		map. Each layer has its own tag with a list of all objects. An object is
		selected by single mouse click and deselected by clicking it again (figure
		5).</P>

	 <P>The selected objects can be viewed on the map. According to the
		activated layer (red box) the selected objects are highlighted in black (see
		figure 6). By clicking on the objects in the map they can also be selected or
		deselected. When an object free area is clicked, all objects are deselected
		again.</P>
