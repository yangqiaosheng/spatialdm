		STYLE="font-weight: bold; font-size: large; text-decoration: underline">Integrated
		criterion:</A></P> 
	 <P>One more application of parallel coordinates plot is evaluation of
		objects on the basis of multiple criteria. There exist a number of
		computational methods to support this activity. In one of them relative
		importance of the criteria is expressed by assigning weights to them. Then an
		integrated score is computed for each object as the weighted average value of
		its performance according to each criterion. Two types of criteria need to be
		distinguished: benefit criteria (bigger values are better) and cost criteria
		(smaller values are better).<BR>Results of evaluation can be explored using a
		parallel coordinates plot with axes for all criteria and for the integrated
		scores (see figure 1). Axes for benefit criteria are oriented from left to
		right, and axes for cost criteria have the opposite direction. Lengths of the
		axes may be (optionally) made proportional to weights of the criteria. <BR>Such
		a display significantly helps in understanding and verification of results of
		the automatic evaluation. According to the construction of the plot, the more
		to the right a line lies, the better is the object it represents. The
		corresponding position on the final score axis will also be closer to the right
		end of the axis. <BR>The visualization allows interactive analysis of
		sensitivity of the final scores to changes of the weights. When any of the
		weights are changed, the scores are immediately recomputed, and the results are
		reflected in the plot. </P>

	 <P>The plot may be linked to a map showing locations of the objects. In
		figure 2 the plot is linked to a map representing the integrated scores of the
		options by degrees of darkness. The line and contours of the best option is
		highlighted in the plot and in the map. The map may represent the final scores,
		for example by painting, and change them in parallel with changes in the
		plot.</P>
