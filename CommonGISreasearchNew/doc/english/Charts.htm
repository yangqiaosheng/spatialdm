	 <P STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Highlighting</P> 
	 <P>The plot is reactive to mouse operations. When the mouse points on some
		line or dot, it is highlighted. This gives an opportunity to estimate attribute
		values associated with the corresponding object and compare characteristics of
		this object to the distribution of characteristics over the whole set of
		objects. <BR>Clicking on a line or dot makes it permanently highlighted (until
		explicit cancellation). This enables pairwise comparison of the selected object
		with other objects. Therefore also point on other objects with the mouse. The
		two objects being compared can be well distinguished as permanent and
		"mouse-on" types of highlighting differ in color (black and white). <BR>In the
		Descartes system a any plot may be dynamically linked to other displays such as
		a map or other plots. This means that objects are highlighted simultaneously in
		all the displays when one selects them in any of the displays. Due to this one
		can explore the set of objects from many perspectives. <BR>Data exploration
		often involves tasks of comparison of attribute values for selected objects and
		comparison of value ranges of several attributes. Such tasks are usually
		relevant to cases when the attributes under investigation are comparable, i.e.
		measured in the same units and semantically related. Examples of such data are
		land cover or land use statistics, division of population according to age
		groups, employment, or marital status, birth and death rates, etc. <BR>The
		system allows easily switching between the different variants of scaling of
		parallel coordinates.</P>

		NAME="C1">Dot plot (horizontal and vertical):</A></P> 
	 <P>One possibility of visualizing attributes is done with dot plots, either
		horizontal (figure 1) or vertical (figure 2). The plot is a bar with
		equidistant lines that divides the bar into 10 units. Each value is presented
		with a little circle. At both ends of the plot the extremal values are
		indicated in black numbers. The triangle-shaped delimiters on either end of the
		bar allow the selection of a part of the value range represented by the slider
		unit. This part can be considered in more detail due to a kind of "zooming"
		that involves some transformations. The values that don't fit into the selected
		interval are not shown on the plot. As a result, the dots become less
		cluttered, the distribution of values within the interval is seen clearer. It
		becomes easier to focus on the values from the studied interval (see figure 1).
		Only the horizontal representation indicates the boundaries of the interval
		(beneath the plot in blue).</P>

	 <P>The scatter plot has a 10x10 grid. Position of a dot on the scatter plot
		can be indicated using the X- and Y-coordinates according to the grid, that is,
		X and Y can take values form 1 to 10.<BR>Selecting several dots at once can be
		done by mouse dragging. It it failed to enclose some of the dots in the
		selection frame, in can add them to the selection by clicking on them. Or they
		can be deactivated by clicking on them again. All selected dots are deactivated
		again by mouse click in an object free part of the scatter plot area or of the
		map</P>

		NAME="C3">Scatter plot matrix:</A></P> 
	 <P>The scatter plot matrix is a square matrix where the names of the
		attributes are on the diagonal and scatter plots every where else. The axes of
		the plots are given through the entries in the diagonal. For example in figure
		4 the plot on position (row 2, column 1) has "% of Pop by age 15-24" on the
		horizontal axis and "total employed in Industrie 1991" on the vertical axis.
		The plots can be manipulated just like normal scatter plots. </P>

		NAME="C4">Parallel coordinates plot:</A></P> 
	 <P>A parallel coordinates plot may have either horizontal or vertical
		orientation of the attribute axis. The orientation has no influence on
		interpretation of the plot and its use. In this implementation the axes are
		horizontal and placed one below another.<BR>In the standard form of parallel
		coordinates plot ("Individual Min and Max" is selected as alignment, below the
		plot) the leftmost position of each axis corresponds to the minimum value of
		the respective attribute, and the rightmost to the maximum value. The leftmost
		and the rightmost positions of the axes are aligned (see figure 5). </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ParallelCoordinates1.gif" WIDTH="562"
		HEIGHT="539" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 5<BR>Europe - Parallel coordinates -
		Individual Min and Max - Age groups</P> 
	 <P>For the tasks of comparison of values and value ranges the standard form
		of the plot is inappropriate. The axes need to be scaled so that the same
		positions correspond to exactly the same number on all the axes. Such scaling
		is illustrated by figure 6. The plot represents the same data as in figure 5:
		percentages of people in three age groups (0-14 years, 15-64 years, and 65 and
		more years) in countries of Europe. It is well visible that the part of the
		middle-age population is bigger in all countries than parts of other age
		groups. Such an extreme case was selected in order to demonstrate clearly the
		difference of the suggested scaling method from the "standard" form of parallel
		coordinates plot.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ParallelCoordinates2.gif" WIDTH="562"
		HEIGHT="539" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 6<BR>Europe - Parallel coordinates - Common
		Min and Max - Age groups</P> 
	 <P>An important activity in exploratory analysis is investigation of
		relationships among attributes. It involves comparison of value variation of
		different attributes and seeking for correlation between attributes. A parallel
		coordinates plot can effectively support these tasks. Thus, if the lines
		between two neighboring axes are nearly parallel to each other, the attributes
		are positively correlated. If almost all the lines have either north-east to
		south-west or north-west to south-east orientation, the attributes are
		negatively correlated. Evidently, in order to detect such pairs of correlated
		attributes, one can change the order of the attribute axes. It may be also
		helpful to "flip" some of the axes. <BR>Another possibility to compare objects
		is done by "Selected object(s)" (figure 7). Here the selected object is
		centered and the axes are adjusted in scale. When more objects are selected
		Descartes calculates the average and uses that.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ParallelCoordinates8.gif" WIDTH="562"
		HEIGHT="539" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 7<BR>Europe - Parallel coordinates -
		Selected object(s) - Age groups</P> 
	 <P>However, the canonical form of parallel coordinates plot may become
		inconvenient if the data contain outliers, i.e. values standing far apart from
		the bulk of values. Presence of outliers complicates the tasks of detecting
		correlated pairs of attributes as well as the tasks of comparison of objects.
		For such cases two methods of scaling of the axes are suggested: 1.)
		normalization by median and quartiles; 2.) normalization by mean and standard
		deviation. <BR>An additional variant of scaling is shown in figure 8. The axes
		are positioned so that median values of all attributes are on the same vertical
		line and are scaled so that the first and the second quartiles are also
		aligned. Positions of the rest of the values are found by linear
		interpolation.</P>

		HEIGHT="537" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 8<BR>Europe - Parallel coordinates - Medians
		and Quartiles - Age groups</P> 
	 <P> In figure 9 the the leftmost and the rightmost positions of the axes
		are aligned which sometimes may facilitate the comparison of some
		attributes.</P>

		HEIGHT="539" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 9<BR>Europe - Parallel coordinates -
		Min-Max, Medians and Quartiles - Age groups</P> 
	 <P>In a similar way, in the second variant the values
		<B STYLE="text-decoration:overline"> &Chi; </B>,
		<B STYLE="text-decoration: overline">&Chi;</B>-&sigma; and
		<B STYLE="text-decoration: overline">&Chi;</B>+&sigma; are used for axes
		scaling (here <B STYLE="text-decoration: overline">&Chi;</B> is the arithmetic
		mean and &sigma; is the standard deviation). This variant is shown in figure
		10. Besides neutralizing the impact of outliers, both variant of scaling are
		good for investigation of general characteristics of value variation.</P>
