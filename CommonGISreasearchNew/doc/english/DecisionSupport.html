In Descartes there are 3 tools for decision support: 
	 <UL> 
		<LI> <A HREF="#ideal_point">"Ideal Point" method</A> (based on computations)</LI> 
		<LI> <A HREF="#utility_signs">"Utility Bars"</A> method of cartographic
		  visualisation</LI> 
		<LI> <A HREF="#utility_signs">"Utility Wheels"</A> method of cartographic
		  visualisation</LI> 
	 </UL> 
       In decision making a person deals with options characterized by a
	 number of attributes. Some of these attributes can be used as decision
	 <B>criteria</B>. Descartes assumes that criteria are always numeric attributes.
	 Hence, if you wish to use a qualitative attribute as a criterion, you should
	 specify an order of preference among its values and encode the values by
	 numbers like 1, 2, 3, ... or -1, 0, 1. 
	 <P><A NAME="criteria_types"></A>There are 2 <B>types of criteria</B>:
		benefit criteria and cost criteria. If higher attribute values make an option
		better (more appropriate), this attribute is a <B>benefit criterion</B>. If
		higher attribute values are less desirable (less appropriate) than lower ones,
		this is a <B>cost criterion</B>. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="criteria_weights"></A>Criteria may have different relative
		importance for a decision maker. In Descartes relative importance of criteria
		is specified through so-called <B>weights of criteria</B>. Weights are real
		numbers between 0 and 1. The sum of weights of all criteria used in the
		decision-making process is always equal to 1. The weight 0 means that the
		corresponding criterion is of no importance for the decision maker. </P> 
	 <P>Options can be spatially distributed. Descartes shows locations of such
		options on maps. </P>

	 <H2> <A NAME="set_types"></A>The interface for setting types and relative
		weights of criteria</H2> All the decision support instruments we propose allow
	 the user to indicate the type of each criterion and to specify relative
	 importance (weights) of criteria. The user interface to specify types and
	 weights of decision criteria is shown in the figure. <BR><IMG SRC="weights.gif"
	 HEIGHT="382" WIDTH="223" ALT="1"> <BR>The arrows indicate and allow the user to
	 specify <A HREF="#criteria_types">criteria types</A>. The North-East pointing
	 arrow, to the left of each weight slider, indicates a benefit criterion, the
	 South-East pointing arrow corresponds to a cost criterion. Initially the system
	 assumes all criteria to be benefit criteria. To change the default
	 directionality of a criterion to the actual one, click on the corresponding
	 arrow with the mouse. Mouse click changes North-East arrow to South-East and
	 vice versa. 
	 <P>Below each criterion name there is a slider allowing the user to
		select/adjust the <A HREF="#criteria_weights">criterion weight </A>within the
		value range (0, 1). To change the weight of a criterion, drag the corresponding
		slider along the horizontal axis. The adjustment of one weight causes all other
		weights to automatically change values proportionally to their values before
		the adjustment in order to keep the sum of weights equal to 1. </P> 
	 <P><A HREF="#top">Goto beginning</A> </P> 
	 <H2> <A NAME="utility_signs"></A>Utility signs</H2> "Utility signs" support
	 visual evaluation of spatially distributed options and search for suitable
	 options on a map. In Descartes there are two variants of utility signs: utility
	 bar charts and utility wheels. <BR><IMG SRC="bar+pie.gif" HEIGHT="59"
	 WIDTH="270" ALT="2"> <BR>A utility sign consists of several graphical elements
	 (see the figure above): bars in utility bar charts and circle segments in
	 utility wheels. Each element corresponds to one of the attributes under
	 consideration (decision criterion). One dimension of an element (height in a
	 bar and radius in a circle segment) represents the value of the attribute for
	 the object this sign stands for. When the attribute is a benefit criterion, the
	 size is proportional to the value, for a cost criterion the inverse proportion
	 is kept. Hence, better values are always represented by bigger sizes. The other
	 dimension (width in a bar and angle in a circle segment) represents the
	 importance of the criterion. When the user interactively changes the weights of
	 the criteria, the signs on the map are immediately redrawn. <BR>By the
	 construction of a sign, the total area of all its elements shows approximately
	 the &#147;goodness&#148;, or utility, of the object this sign stands for.
	 Hence, a decision maker needs to look on the map for signs with largest areas. 
	 <P>To simplify estimation of areas of utility signs and, thereby, visual
		evaluation of options, the signs can be supplemented with frames showing the
		maximum area (see the above figure on the right). This area corresponds to best
		possible values of all the attributes. </P> 
	 <P><A HREF="#top">Goto beginning</A> </P> 
	 <H3> <A NAME="focusing"></A>Focusing on best options</H3> To facilitate
	 visual searching for best options on the map, there is an interactive control
	 (on the right of the map, in the "Manipulate" tab) that allows the user to
	 remove from view the signs with areas smaller than a specified threshold (in
	 percents to the maximum possible area). For this purpose the user needs to drag
	 the left triangle in the control (see below) to the right. <BR><IMG
	 SRC="utility_focuser.gif" HEIGHT="56" WIDTH="229" ALT="3"> <BR>Thus, the map in
	 the figure below includes only signs with areas no less than 50% of the maximum
	 possible area. Note that <A HREF="#set_types">manipulation of weights of the
	 criteria</A> changes areas of the signs and therefore can make some of the
	 currently visible signs disappear and some of the hidden signs become visible.

	 HREF="#top">Goto beginning</A> 
	 <H3> <A NAME="utility_comparison"></A>Visual comparison of options using
		"Utility bars"</H3> You can compare utility (degree of suitability) of options
	 represented by "utility bars" using the "visual comparison" operation. <BR><IMG
	 SRC="utility_compare_signs.gif" HEIGHT="144" WIDTH="215" ALT="5"> <BR>In the
	 "visual comparison" mode (see the picture above) one option is interactively
	 selected as a reference option. It is represented on the map by a horizontal
	 line. The remaining options are shown in a special way: a value of an attribute
	 for an option is shown by an upward-oriented bar if this value is more
	 preferable than the value of this attribute for the reference option. Less
	 preferable values are shown by downward-oriented bars. Note that higher
	 attribute values are more preferable if the attribute is a
	 <A HREF="#criteria_types">benefit criterion</A> and less preferable if it is a
	 <A HREF="#criteria_types">cost criterion</A>. The heights of the bars show the
	 degree of preference. The widths of the bars, as usual, are proportional to the
	 <A HREF="#criteria_weights">relative importances (weights) of the criteria</A>.

	 There are two ways of doing visual comparison. 
	 <P><B>1)</B> On the right of the map, in the "Manipulation" tab there is a
		drop-down list with the names of the options. Initially, the text "Select
		object for comparison" is visible. When you press the arrow button on the right
		of it, you get the whole list and can select an option from it. After the
		selection the name of the reference (i.e. selected) option will be shown (see
		below). </P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P><IMG SRC="utility_compare_map.gif" HEIGHT="269" WIDTH="596"
		ALT="6"><BR><B>2)</B> Comparison by clicking on an object in the map. Below the
		drop-down list of options in the "Manipulation" area there is a check box
		"compare by click in" (see above). Check this check box. After this, when you
		click on an option in the map, it becomes the reference object for comparison,
		and the map is immediately redrawn. The name of the option is shown in the
		header of the drop-down list of options. When you click in an object-free area,
		the reference object is deselected, and the bar charts are drawn in their
		"normal" mode. </P> 
	 <P>Below the check box "compare by click in" there is a drop-down list in
		which you can select between "this map" (default selection) and "any display".
		When you select "any display", the visual comparison tool will react to click
		in any display opened in Descartes (e.g. another map, scatter plot, etc.). </P>
	 
	 <P><A HREF="#top">Goto beginning</A> </P> 
	 <H2> <A NAME="ideal_point"></A>"Ideal point" method</H2> Descartes can
	 compute aggregated scores of options from multiple criteria according to the
	 so-called &#147;Ideal point&#148; method known in the decision-making theory.
	 Like "Utility signs", the method uses the <A
	 HREF="#criteria_weights">weights</A> assigned to the criteria by the decision
	 maker. The <A HREF="#set_types">interface for setting the weights</A> is the
	 same as for the "Utility signs". Results of computation are represented on the
	 parallel coordinate plot together with the source data. 
	 <H3> <A NAME="parallel"></A>Parallel coordinate plot</H3> A "parallel
	 coordinate plot" is applied when it is necessary to consider simultaneously
	 multiple attributes (usually more than two). It includes several horizontal
	 axes, one axis per each attribute under consideration. The length of an axis
	 represents the value range of the corresponding attribute. Hence, an attribute
	 value can be represented by a position on the axis. An object is represented by
	 a broken line ("value path") connecting the positions on the neighboring axes
	 corresponding to the attribute values for this objects (see the picture below).
	 <BR><IMG SRC="pcp_standard.gif" HEIGHT="387" WIDTH="325" ALT="7"> 
	 <P>In Descartes the parallel coordinate plot display is dynamically linked
		with maps and other displays. When the user points with the mouse on some
		option represented in the map, the respective object is highlighted in the map,
		and the corresponding value path is highlighted in the parallel coordinate
		plot. And vice versa, the user may point at some line segment in the plot, and
		the whole value path becomes highlighted as well as the position of the
		corresponding option in the map. Such value path/map integration makes it easy
		to evaluate any option with regard to all the criteria. Additionally, the user
		may &#147;fix&#148; highlighting by clicking on an object in the map or on a
		line in the plot. The selected object remains highlighted when the mouse cursor
		moves out of the display or points at other objects. This enables the
		comparison of value paths of two or more decision options. The fixed
		highlighting differs in color from transient highlighting (black and white,
		respectively). </P> 
	 <P>A parallel coordinate plot display used for decision support is
		specifically constructed to account for peculiarities of decision making tasks:
		different directions of criteria (benefit or cost) and variation of weights. In
		the variants of the parallel coordinates plot we propose for decision making
		the axes for benefit and cost criteria have different orientation: left to
		right vs. right to left. The orientation is indicated by arrows. With such a
		solution, the best values of each attribute are always on the right, and the
		worst on the left. This makes it easy to estimate visually how good any
		specific option is: the closer to the right edge of the plot is a line, the
		better is the option. </P> 
	 <P>Difference in relative weights of criteria can be reflected by variation
		of lengths of the axes: the more important is a criterion, the longer is the
		corresponding axis (see the picture below). Due to this transformation lines of
		options surpassing others in more important criteria shift visually more to the
		right (&#147;good&#148;) pole of the plot. </P> 
	 <P></P> 
	 <P><IMG SRC="pcp-ds.gif" HEIGHT="398" WIDTH="553" ALT="8"><BR>Besides the
		characteristics of the options with respect to the criteria, the parallel
		coordinate plot in the "Ideal point" dialog shows also the results of
		computation: the summary evaluation scores of the options (given the current
		weights of the criteria) and the ranking (order) of the options according to
		the scores. The scores and the ranking are represented on the bottom two axes
		of the plot: the scores on the axis second from the bottom, and the ranking on
		the bottom axis. The score axis is oriented from left to right since higher
		scores are better, and the ranking axis - from right to left (the best option
		is the first in ranking, and the worst is the last). Such a display
		significantly helps in understanding and verification of the outcome of
		automatic evaluation. It also allows interactive analysis of sensitivity of the
		aggregated scores to changes of the weights. When the user alters any of the
		weights, the scores are immediately re-computed, and the results are reflected
		in the plot. </P> 
	 <P><A HREF="#top">Goto beginning</A> </P> 
	 <H3> Link between the "Ideal point" dialog and the map</H3> When the "Ideal
	 point" dialog is started, the results of calculations by the "Ideal point"
	 method (specifically, the ranking of the options) are immediately represented
	 on the map, and the map dynamically reacts to all changes within the dialog
	 (weights, directionality of criteria, adding/removing criteria, etc.) 
	 <P>There are two methods that can be used to represent ranking: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI> Proportional degrees of darkness</LI> 
		<LI> Classification map</LI> 
	 </UL> Which of the methods is used, depends on the state of the check box
	 "Classify results" in the "Ideal point" dialog. When the check box is
	 "checked", classification is used, otherwise the proportional degrees of
	 darkness method. 
	 <H4> Representation of ranking by proportional degrees of darkness</H4> In
	 this representation method values of a numeric attribute are encoded by
	 proportional degrees of darkness: the higher the value, the darker the shade
	 representing it. Hence, better options (with small values of the "ranking"
	 attribute) are lighter, and less preferable options are darker (see below).
	 <BR><IMG SRC="ranking_continuous.gif" HEIGHT="382" WIDTH="574" ALT="9"> <BR>A
	 double-sided, or diverging, color scale may be used in order to differentiate
	 visually values above and below certain reference value (midpoint): they are
	 represented by shades of two different colors, for example, brown and blue. A
	 special color, for example, white, represents values exactly equal to the
	 reference value. The system gives you an opportunity to change interactively
	 the reference value and to observe immediately how this affects the map. This
	 operation (called "visual comparison") can facilitate comparison of options and
	 visual detection of the best options. For example, by setting the reference
	 value to 5.5 (or any number between 5 and 6) you visually isolate 5 best
	 options from the rest: they will be shown in a different color, by default, in
	 blue (see below). <BR><IMG SRC="ranking_compare.gif" HEIGHT="382" WIDTH="571"
