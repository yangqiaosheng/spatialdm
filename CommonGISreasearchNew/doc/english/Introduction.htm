	 <P>Descartes, a Java based GIS (geographic information system) accessable
		in the internet, supports the creation and interactive analysis of thematic
		maps. The user can choose out of a set of spacial statistical values and
		Descartes creates automatically a set of maps using cartographic knowledge
		which visually include the values and their relationships.</P> 
	 <P> It is a domain-independent software. Its domain-specific instantiations
		are called applications. From the system's perspective, an application is a
		number of files with data to visualize and analyze together with some service
		files that inform the system how to handle the data. <BR>An application should
		include data files of two kinds: <BR>&middot; tables with attribute data
		referred to some spatial objects (districts, towns, countries, and so on). The
		objects are denoted in the tables by their identifiers. A table should contain
		a column with object identifiers;<BR> &middot; geographic layers, i.e. files
		containing points, lines, or areas (polygons) in vector format. For each table
		there should be a geographic layer containing the spatial objects from this
		table. These objects should have in the geographic layer the same identifiers
		as in the table. <BR>An application may include several tables referring to one
		and the same geographic layer as well as to different layers. A table may not
		refer to several geographic layers at once. There may be any number of
		geographic layers in an application. The layers that do not contain objects
		from a table may create a geographical background for data presentation. Which
		layers are available in an application is presented in the legend of the map.
		</P> 
	 <P>In Descartes it is possible to build multiple displays representing
		different attributes of the same data set or, possibly, the same attributes in
		different ways. Thus, the user can open one or more maps and various kinds of
		non-cartographic displays: dot plots, scatter plots, parallel coordinate plots.
		All these displays are dynamically linked. Thus, when the user points with the
		mouse on an object in one of the displays, the graphical elements corresponding
		to this object (contour in a map, dot in a dot plot or a scatter plot, line in
		a parallel coordinate plot) are simultaneously highlighted in all the displays.
