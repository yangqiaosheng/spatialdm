	 <P>The "choropleth map" visualization method consists in encoding values of
		some attribute referring to units of territory division by colors or shades.
		"Unclassed" means that values of a numeric attribute are converted into degrees
		of darkness directly, without previous classification: the degrees of darkness
		are (roughly) proportional to the numbers they represent. A merit of a
		choropleth map is that it is capable of producing an integral image of the
		spatial distribution of data, and thus enables the highest, overall level of
		map reading. Since the whole distribution can be grasped as one image, it is
		possible to compare two or more distributions presented by choropleth maps. By
		such comparison one can reveal relationships between several variables:
		relatedness will manifest itself in similar spatial patterns.</P>

	 <P>In a so-called unclassed choropleth map values of a numeric attribute
		are encoded by proportional degrees of darkness: the higher the value, the
		darker the shade representing it. </P>

	 <P>Sometimes in such maps a double sided, or diverging, color scale is used
		in order to differentiate visually values above and below certain reference
		value (midpoint): they are represented by shades of two different colors, for
		example, brown and blue. A special color, for example, white, represents values
		exactly equal to the reference value. The Descartes system gives the
		opportunity to change interactively the reference value and to observe
		immediately how this affects the map. This operation (called "visual
		comparison") can enhance visibility of spatial patterns, facilitate comparison
		of entities, and help to locate particular values on the map. This is done by
		either moving the double ended arrow up and down the colored bar with the mouse
		(is the check box "dynamic map update" checked, then changes are directly shown
		in the map), or by clicking on an area that has the reference value (therefor
		check the check box "compare by click in" and in the text field appearing then,
		says "this map").</P>

	 <P>Observe spatial patterns and trends. Gradually move the "midpoint"
		through the whole value range of the attribute. Observe changes of the patterns
		formed by two different colors, regardless of the degrees of darkness. For
		example, on the figure 2 one can observe how blue shades (corresponding to low
		values) spread from the areas around the biggest cities of Portugal such as
		Lisbon and Porto first along the coast and then into the inner parts of the
		country.</P>

		of outliers from presentation:</A></P> 
	 <P>Very often a data sample under study contains a few very high or very
		low values of a numeric attribute while the rest values are relatively close to
		each other. Such values are called outliers. For example, the birth rates in
		all but one countries of Europe lie between 10.56 and 14.51 births per 10000
		population while this single country has 21.70. Maps as well as other graphical
		displays built to represent such data sets can be insufficiently expressive
		with regard to the mainstream values, that is, differences between these values
		can be hardly perceivable from the presentation. Removal of outliers from view
		gives an opportunity to match expressive means available to a shorter value

		STYLE="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline">Classification:</A></P>
	 
	 <P>A widely used method for cartographic representation of values of a
		numeric attribute is classification-based painting. According to this method,
		the value range of the attribute is divided into intervals that are assigned
		different colors. Geographical objects are painted in the map according to the
		intervals into which the corresponding attribute values fit. </P> 
	 <P>The tools include direct manipulation controls for specifying arbitrary
		class boundaries, graphs representing statistical distribution of attribute
		values, means for automatic classification, calculation of statistical quality
		of a classification, and various color schemes that can be applied to represent
		classes on a choropleth map.</P> 
	 <P>Historically, classification was used in order to minimize the number of
		colors needed for representing data values on printed maps. This goal together
		with the task of minimizing subjectivity of data representation lead to
		development of 3 widely used methods of data classification (figure 7):<BR>1)
		classification into equal intervals; <BR>2) classification with equal
		frequencies of objects in the classes; <BR>3) statistically optimal
		classification. </P>

		classification of "%_Of_Pop_by_age_&gt;=65": equal interval classification,
		equal frequency classification, and statistically optimal classification</P> 
	 <P>It is well known in cartography that different selection of the number
		of classes and class breaks can radically change the information perceived from
		the map. This can be seen, for example, from comparison of the choropleth maps
		shown in figure 7. These maps result from three variants of classification of
		Portugal regions into 3 classes according to values of the attribute
		"%_Of_Pop_by_age_&gt;=65", but it is rather hard to believe that they represent
		the same data. The effect of classification can be observed by comparing these
		maps to an unclassed choropleth map representing the same attribute (<A
		HREF="#F1">figure 1</A>). </P> 
	 <P>There are following tools for defining classes: <BR>1) Automatic
		classification methods: equal interval classification, equal frequency
		classification, and statistically optimal classification. Two ways of using
		these methods are possible: the user can either specify the desired number of
		classes or the desired quality. In the latter case the number of classes
		required will be automatically found by the system. To apply the methods press
		"run".<BR>2) A text editing control which lists current values of the breaks.
		One can edit the break values, remove breaks, and introduce new breaks within
		this control. <BR>3) A compound slider, which visually represents relative
		positions of the class breaks between the minimum and the maximum values of the
		attribute and displays the currently used color scheme (figure 8). The control
		is supplied with a dot plot that represents statistical distribution of the
		attribute values. </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="classification1.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="499"
		BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 8<BR>Portugal - Classification -
		%_of_Pop_by_age_&gt;=65</P> 
	 <P>The compound slider is a direct manipulation control. One can move any
		of slider pointers and in this way update the classification. When a pointer
		approaches one of its neighbors, it is removed (i.e. two consecutive classes
		are merged). When clicked in a free space between two slider pointers, a new
		class break is added that divides the respective class into two classes.
		<BR>The compound slider has a special function: during the process of movement
		of a slider pointer only the objects belonging to the two classes affected by
		the corresponding boundary change are shown on the map by painting, while the
		remaining objects are shown in neutral gray color. This helps to concentrate
		better on the changes of the spatial patterns resulting from the movement of
		the boundary. <BR>All figures are immediately updated after any change of the
		classes, in particular, during movement of a slider pointer.</P> 
	 <P>In the result of any classification the data loose their precision. The
		amount of precision lost (i.e. the statistical error introduced by the
		classification) can be measured. The total error of a classification is
		calculated as a sum of internal errors for each individual class, E=&Sigma;Ek.
		The internal class error Ek is calculated depending on the chosen measure of
		diversity. We introduce 3 measures of diversity named "mean measure", "median
		measure", and "entropy measure": <BR>The first measure is calculated as a
		squared deviation from the class mean: Ek= &Sigma;(Xi-<B
		STYLE="text-decoration: overline">X</B>k)^2, where
		<B STYLE="text-decoration: overline">X</B>k is the class mean. The second
		measure is calculated as a sum of absolute deviations from the class median,
		Ek=&Sigma;abs(Xi-<B STYLE="text-decoration: line-through">X</B>k), where<B
		STYLE="text-decoration: line-through">X</B>k is the class median. This measure
		is less affected by extremes in the tails of the distribution (outliers) than
		the first measure because the data in the tails have less influence on the
		median than on the mean. The third measure aggregates deviations from the mean
		using logarithm function conventional in information theoretic approaches,
		Ek=&Sigma;abs(Xi-<B STYLE="text-decoration: overline">X</B>k)log(abs( Xi-<B
		STYLE="text-decoration: overline">X</B>k+1)). If the deviation is small the
		function increases approximately as the mean squared deviation (the first
		measure) while for large deviations it grows much slower, so that outliers make
		less contribution into the total error. </P> 
	 <P>For each classification produced by the system or modified by the user
		we compute 2 indicators of the quality. The first represents the loss of
		precision in the result of the classification. The second is a ratio of the
		first value to the value for the statistically optimal classification with the
		same number of classes. Hence, the first indicator expresses how far the
		classification is from the original data set, and the second one - how far it
		is from the optimal classification. In order to find the optimal
		classification, an algorithm is used, that has a special iterative organization
		when classifications obtained on earlier steps are efficiently used on the next
		steps. <BR>Both quality indicators are presented as numbers measured in the
		scale 0% to 100% as well as graphically (see figure 9). The indicators are
		automatically updated after each change of the classes. </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ClassificationError.gif" WIDTH="221"
		HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 9<BR>Representation of the statistical
		quality of a classification</P> 
	 <P>In classification of spatially referenced data an analyst needs to
		consider the data from two perspectives, statistical and spatial, and take into
		account the peculiarities of both the statistical and the spatial distributions
		of the data. This means that the analyst needs to pursue at least two
		concurrent goals. The first is to minimize variation of data within each class
		and to maximize differences between classes. The second goal is to divide the
		territory into the smallest possible number of coherent regions with low data
		variation within the regions. The analyst needs such tools that would allow
		her/him to balance between these goals in search of an acceptable compromise
		solution. Whereas the statistically optimal classification algorithm is suited
		to the first goal, it does not take into account the spatial aspect of the data
		and, hence, cannot help in approaching the second goal. Therefore so important
		is the "freehand" classification procedure described above: class breaks can be
		moved and immediately the changes of the patterns are observed on a map. A
		visual representation of the statistical value distribution can help the
		analyst to meet also the statistical criteria in the course of interactive
		classification. The dot plot accompanying the compound slider could be suitable
		for these purposes, but overlapping of point symbols in it obscures
		understanding of the distribution.</P> 
	 <P>One more method for graphical representation of statistical distribution
		is the cumulative frequency curve, or ogive. In such a graph the horizontal
		axis represents the value range of an attribute. The vertical position of each
		point of the curve corresponds to the number of objects with values of the
		attribute being less than or equal to the value represented by the horizontal
		position of this point. Peculiarities of value distribution can be perceived
		from the shape of the ogive. Steep segments correspond to clusters of close
		values. The height of such a segment shows the number of the close values.
		Horizontal segments correspond to "natural breaks" in the sequence of
		values.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
		SRC="CumulativeFrequencyCurve.gif"
		WIDTH="790" HEIGHT="610" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 10<BR>Cumulative frequency
		curve</P> 
	 <P>It is important that the cumulative frequency curve does not require
		prior classification. However it can represent results of classification by
		means of additional graphical elements. Thus, the horizontal axis of the graph
		may be suited to show class breaks. For this purpose Descartes uses segmented
		bars with segments representing the classification intervals. The segments are
		painted in the colors of the classes. The positions of the breaks are projected
		onto the curve, and the corresponding points of the curve are, in their turn,
		projected onto the vertical axis. The division of the vertical axis is also
		shown with the use of colored segmented bars. The lengths of the segments are
		proportional to the numbers of objects in the corresponding classes. With such
		a construction it becomes easy to compare the sizes of the classes. For
		example, the class breaks shown in figure 11 divide the whole set of objects
		into 3 groups of approximately equal size that is demonstrated by the equal
		lengths of the bar segments on the vertical axis. </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
		SRC="CumulativeFrequencyCurveClassified.gif"
		WIDTH="478" HEIGHT="349" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 11<BR>Classes on a cumulative
		frequency curve</P> 
	 <P>The use of the map and the cumulative frequency graph within the tool
		for classification allows the user to balance between the statistical and
		geographical criteria. For example, after looking at the graph shown in figure
		11 one may wish to move the lower break from the area of clustering (indicated
		by a steep segment of the curve) to the horizontal segment on the left of it.
		This operation will improve the classification from the statistical
		perspective. At the same time one can see how this affects the pattern visible
		on the map. When there is a break on a gentle slope, it may be reasonable to
		try to swing it around this position in search of a simpler spatial pattern. It
		is also possible to focus during break movement on the vertical axis of the
		graph and produce classes with desired relative sizes (numbers of objects).
		</P> 
	 <P>In particular application domains additional classification criteria may
		come into play in combination with the statistical and geographical ones. For
		example, in demographic analyses it may be important to produce classes of
		districts that do not differ too much in total number of population that lives
		in them.</P> 
	 <P>It is possible to generalize the idea of the cumulative frequency curve
		and to build similar graphs summarizing values of arbitrary quantitative
		attributes. Examples of such attributes are area, population number, gross
		domestic product, number of households, etc. A generalized cumulative curve is
		built in the following way. Let the horizontal axis correspond to attribute A
		and the vertical to attribute B. The curve matches each value x of A with the
		sum of values of B computed for objects with the values of A being less than or
		equal to x. So, the maximum value of A will correspond to the total sum of
		values of B for all the objects of the sample. Let, for example, the districts
		of Leicestershire be classified according to the number of cars per capita, and
		a generalized cumulative curve represent the attribute "Total population". Then
		the vertical position corresponding to x cars per capita would reflect the
		total number of population living in districts with no more than x cars per
		capita.</P> 
	 <P>The classification tool of Descartes allows to add a generalized curve
		for any quantitative attribute to the cumulative frequency curve display. The
		curves are overlaid, i.e. drawn in the same panel (see figure 12). To be better
		discriminated, the curves differ in color. The horizontal axis is common for
		all of them. The vertical axes are shown beside each other on the left of the
		graph. Each of the vertical axes is divided into the same number of segments,
		but positions of the breaks are, in general, different. This is clearly
		demonstrated in figure 12. It shows that 34% of all districts fit in the lower
		class of the classification. They occupy only 10% of the total area but contain
		50% of total population.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
		SRC="CumulativeFrequencyCurveGeneralized.gif"
		WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="238" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 12<BR>Generalized cumulative
		curves are built for the attributes "Area" and "Total population". The
		classification is done on the basis of the attribute "Number of cars per
		capita".</P> 
	 <P>Having such a tool, it is easy to account in classification for such
		criteria as even distribution of population among the classes, or approximately
		equal total areas occupied by the classes, or other specific criteria that may
		emerge in this or that application domain. Thus, to make classes approximately
		equal in total population, the analyst should focus in the process of slider
		movement on the axis corresponding to total population and try to position the
		sliders so that the axis is divided into segments of equal length.</P> 
	 <P>Besides this opportunity, generalized cumulative curves may be used for
		exploring relationships between various characteristics of the classified
		objects. Let us demonstrate this on the example of exploration of unemployment
		in Leicestershire. We used the attributes "Number of unemployed" and "Total
		population" to calculate percentage of unemployed in total population in each
		district. Then we took this new attribute as the basis for classification. The
		classification tool showed us that proportion of unemployed in population
		varies from 0.9% to 13.62%. We considered values above 4% to be very high and
		wondered in how many districts this threshold is exceeded and where these
		districts are located. We entered 4 as a class break and in this way divided
		all districts into two classes: with up to 4% of unemployed persons in
		population and with more than 4%. The cumulative curve display showed us that
		only 18% of all districts fit in the upper class (figure 13). The map shows a
		vivid spatial cluster of such districts in the centre of the area. It is seen
		that these districts occupy a rather small part of the whole area. However,
		when we selected the attribute "Total population" for representation on the
		cumulative curve display, we found that the districts with high unemployment
		contain 33% of the total population of Leicestershire.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
		SRC="CumulativeFrequencyCurveexample.gif"
		WIDTH="959" HEIGHT="351" BORDER="0"><BR>Figure 13<BR>The use of generalized
		cumulative curves for exploration of unemployment in Leicestershire</P> 
	 <P>We became interested whether there is a link between unemployment and
		distribution of national minorities. We added to the cumulative curve display
		the attribute BLAFR representing total numbers of people originating from
		Africa by districts. In figure 13 it is vividly seen that the curve for this
		population group radically differs from that for the whole population. It is
		also seen that the axis corresponding to this attribute is divided in quite a
		different proportion than those for the frequency and for the whole population.
		Only 28% of people with African origin live in districts with lower
		unemployment and, hence, 72% live in districts with more than 4% unemployed in
		total population. The difference is even more dramatic for people originating
		from India (represented by the attribute EGINDIAN). One can see that 81% of
		these people live in the areas with high unemployment.</P> 
	 <P>We continued our investigation of unemployment by moving the class break
		so that the population was divided into two equal parts. Figure 14 shows the
		result of this operation. The new value of the class break is 2.89. This means
		that 50% of total population lives in districts with more than 2.89% of
		unemployed. These districts, as it is seen from the map, constitute a rather
		small part of the whole territory of the county. Hence, the population density
		in them is higher than in the rest of the districts. Apparently, these are
		mainly urban districts. The map shows also that the districts with higher
		unemployment are spatially clustered. The national minorities considered above
		are now distributed between the classes of districts in the following way: only
		14% of Indians and 18% of Africans live in the districts with lower
		unemployment, and, hence, 86% and 82%, respectively, live in the areas with
		more than 2.89% unemployed in population.</P>

		can be changed by clicking on the colored box next to the value names. Is the
		little check box not checked, then this value is not shown in the map (dark
		grey objects). In figure 17 the different religions in Europe are represented
		and "Lutheran" is not active (see Iceland, Norway, Denmark, etc.).</P>

	 <P>With this comparison method the selected attributes are displayed in
		bars next to each other. It is not possible to stress one or more attributes
		like working with other methods such as the utility bars (explained
		<A HREF="#M10">here</A>). In the manipulation area a multiple dot plot is
		shown. Each attribute has its own vertical plot. The value range is valid for
		all attributes and starts at zero by default but can be changed by dragging the
		lower delimiter upwards or changing the value in the textbox titeled "Min". The
		hight of the bars correspond proportionally to the maximum height of the bars,
		the value range and the value itself. Changing the color or comparing with
		specified values is done as in the other methods.</P>

	 <P>The order of the attributes can be changed by dragging them to the

		letting go. The colors can be changed by clicking on the colored boxes next to
		the attributes name. To display the diameter of the circles proportionally to
		the sum just check the check box "Diameter proportional to sum". Underneath
		this box is a bar that focuses. It removes large pies and makes small ones
		lager and better visible. This action makes sense, when the diameter is
		proportional to the sum.</P>

	 <P>Two selected attributes can be visualized by triangles. What axis
		belonging to which attribute is shown in the middle part of the legend by small
		double arrows. Using figure 19 as an example one can see that: vertical
		(up-down): Beginner level runs in %; horizontal (left-right): Price for ski
		pass (6 days). The numbers shown next to the triangles are the extreme values
		of each attribute. To the right are the ones for the vertical attribute and
		underneath are the ones for the horizontal attribute. The four triangles
		displayed show the extreme shape a triangle can take: upper left: max of
		Beginner runs and min of Price; lower left: min of both attributes; upper
		right: max of both attributes; lower right: min of Beginner runs and max of
		Price. For somebody who goes skiing for the first time a triangle of the shape
		tall and thin is wished. S/he would probably choose La Forclaz (black circle at
		mouse pointer).</P>

		bars:</A></P> 
	 <P>The visualization of utility bars are similar to standalone bars only
		more attributes can be added easily with the text fields on the bottom right.
		Different attributes are displayed in different colors that can be changed by
		clicking on the colored box next to the attributes name. Comparing the objects
		by the value of one selected object can be done by "compare by click in" or by
		selecting an object from the object list (upper right). Different weights can
		be applied to different attributes to emphasize them by moving the slider in
		the bar beneath the name of the attribute. The current weight value is
		displayed to the right of it. The button "Set equal weights" gives all
		attributes the same weights. The arrow left of the attributes name specifies
		whether the attribute is to be maximized or minimized. Is it pointing to the
		upper right it stands for maximizing (benefit, higher values are better) and
		when it points to the lower right it stands for minimizing (costs, smaller
		values are better). Depending on the weight and on the optimization direction
		(min or max), Descartes determines the results by integrating over the area of
		the frame and sorts them by percentage value. In the grey bar above the weight
		settings one can determine which utility bars are to be shown on the map (the
		grey shaded ones, also indicated above the bar). More about comparing
		attributes is explained in <A HREF="DecisionSupport.html">decision
		support</A>.</P>

	 <P>To change the parameters of the diagrams click the button "Setup
		diagrams" (see figure 22). Here the maximum height and width can be adjusted. A
		frame, a thin line around the maximal values, can be set. And the order of
		segments can be prescribed: preserved: keeps order of attributes, descending:
		sorts by decrease of height and ascending: sorts by increase of height.</P>
