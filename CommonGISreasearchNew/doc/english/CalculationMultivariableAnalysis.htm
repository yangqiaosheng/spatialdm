		(distance)</A></P> 
	 <P>An interesting and useful kind of data analysis can be done on the base
		of calculation of the degree of similarity, or of the distance between objects
		in the multidimensional attribute space. Analysis of similarity can help
		understand the distribution of characteristics over a set of objects.<BR>The
		referenz object(s) are selected out of a list of all objects (figure 1). It is
		also possible to select them by mouse click on the map when the corresponding
		layer is active (red box in the maplegend).</P>

		object(s)</P> 
	 <P>Descartes has several methods of calculation of distance between objects
		implemented based on various types of metrics . The results of calculation can
		be illustrated on a parallel coordinates plot containing, besides axes for the
		source attributes, an axis with the distance (Figure 2). One can easily find
		the line representing the reference object and compare it with the lines of
		other objects. One possibility is to mark this particular line on the plot with
		transient or durable highlighting. Another possibility is to transform the plot
		so that the reference line becomes straight.<BR>In the latter case all axes are
		shifted without changing their scales. This representation method helps to
		understand and verify the results of distance calculation. The closer a line is
		to the straight reference line, the similar it is to the reference object. The
		user has an opportunity to tune the method of calculation by setting up its
		parameters including the metrics to be used. Any change of the parameters
		immediately results in change of the appearance of the plot. </P> 
	 <P>The different available metrices are:<BR>L1:
		Dist(A,B)=Sum(Abs(Ai-Bi))<BR>L2: Dist(A,B)=Sqrt(Sum(Ai-Bi)^2))<BR>C:
		Dist(A,B)=Max(Abs(Ai-Bi))<BR>T: Special metric for time series data. It
		reflects number of time moments with similar change of values. Do not use with
		non-temporal data! </P>

		 STYLE="font-weight: bold; font-size: large; text-decoration: underline">Similarity
		(classification)</A></P> 
	 <P>On the basis of calculation of distances one may do another exploratory
		data analysis task: classify objects into two classes represented by their
		samples.<BR>The procedure of classification is done in the following
		way:<BR>For each object the system computes distances DI and DII to the given
		samples of the classes I and II. If for some object min(DI,DII)&gt;d0 where d0
		is some specified threshold, this object is not ascribed to any of the classes
		(it is too different from both samples). Otherwise, the object is included in
		the class I if DI&lt;DII or to the class II if DI&gt;DII. The user can select
		different metrics for computing distances as well as vary values of the
		parameters. To change d0 move the slider in "distance threshold for
		classification". The current value can be read off at the right of the
		scale.<BR>The task of similarity-based classification may be also supported
		with a parallel coordinates plot. The plot contains axes for all source
		attributes, the distances to the classes I and II, and the results of
		classification. The latter are encoded by numbers: -1 stands for class I and 1
		for class II, and 0 for non-classified objects. The aces are transformed so
		that the lines for the two samples are straight (this is possible only if
		values of all attributes for these two objects are different). The scale of
		each axis is determined by the difference between the values of the attribute
		for sample I and sample II. The orientation of an axis may change to
		right-to-left in order to make the value for sample I be located on the left of
		that for sample II. The appearance of the plot is shown in figure 4.<BR>The so
		transformed plot illustrates well the results of the classification. If some
		line lies close to the line of one of the samples, the corresponding object
		belongs to the class the sample represents. If some line differs very much form
		the lines of both samples, the object remains unclassified.</P>

	 <P>In a case of analysis of geographically referenced data the results of
		classification are also represented on a map (see figure 5). The objects are
		painted in different colors depending on whether they belong to class I,. class
		II, or are unclassified.<BR> The lines in the figure are colored in blue and
		red, because the check box "Broadcast classification" is checked in the map
		window (figure 5).</P>
