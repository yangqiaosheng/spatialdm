  </HEAD> 
  <BODY BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC"> 
	 <H1> Dynamically linked data displays</H1> In Descartes it is possible to
	 build multiple displays representing different attributes of the same data set
	 or, possibly, the same attributes in different ways. Thus, the user can open
	 one or more maps and various kinds of non-cartographic displays: dot plots,
	 scatter plots, parallel coordinate plots. All these displays are dynamically
	 linked. Thus, when the user points with the mouse on an object in one of the
	 displays, the graphical elements corresponding to this object (contour in a
	 map, dot in a dot plot or a scatter plot, line in a parallel coordinate plot)
	 are simultaneously highlighted in all the displays. 
	 <P>The Descartes system supports two kinds of highlighting: transient and
		durable. Transient ("mouse-over") highlighting occurs when the mouse cursor is
		positioned over an object and is switched off immediately after the mouse is
		moved aside. Durable highlighting occurs when an object is selected by clicking
		or dragging the mouse and lasts until the user explicitly cancels it. Click on
		a durably highlighted object cancels its highlighting. Click in an object-free
		area of any display cancels highlighting of all objects. Descartes uses white
		color for transient highlighting and black for durable highlighting. </P> 
	 <P><U>Important notes</U>: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI> Selection of objects to be durably highlighted by mouse clicking is
		  automatically enabled. However, a user may wish that some map manipulator, such
		  as the visual comparison tool, react to mouse clicking events. When the user
		  selects this option, the manipulator captures the mouse click events, and they
		  are no more used for highlighting. The user can explicitly switch the
		  interpretation of mouse click events back to highlighting using the appropriate
		  controls in the manipulator area.</LI> 
		<LI> Selection by mouse dragging is automatically enabled in all
		  non-cartographic displays. In a map window mouse dragging can be used as well
		  for zooming and shifting of the viewport. The user can switch between different
		  interpretations of mouse dragging using button switches in the tool bar of the
		  map window.</LI> 
		<LI> In a map with several layers only objects of the active layer can be
		  affected by highlighting. To make a layer active, the user should click on it
		  in the legend. When the active layer changes, highlighting of objects from the
		  previously active layer is cancelled. It will appear again when this layer is
		  activated once more.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>For example, having on the screen a map and a scatter plot, an analyst
		can highlight dots in the scatter plot she finds interesting and look on the
		map where the corresponding objects are located. She can also select objects in
		the map and analyze their positions among other objects in the scatter
		plot.</P>
