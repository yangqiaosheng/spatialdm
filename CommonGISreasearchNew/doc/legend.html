<h1>
<font size=+2>Editing of the visual properties of map layers and the order
of the layers in a map</font></h1>
A map window contains a subwindow with the map legend. The legend (see
Figure 1) shows the layers the map consists of, the status (drawn or hidden)
of each layer, the visual properties such as colour or line thickness,
the order of the layers in the map, and the active layer. The active layer
is the layer the objects of which react to mouse events, that is, pointing
on an object with the mouse cursor or clicking on an object.

<br>Figure 1. An example map legend.
<p>For each map layer there is an item in the legend that consists of the
following elements:
<ul>
<li>
"Plus" or "minus" icon indicating whether the layer is drawn or not. The
icon is sensitive to mouse clicks. Upon a mouse click the icon is changed
to the opposite (that is, plus to minus and vice versa), and so does the
drawing status of the layer.</li>

<li>
An image representing the type of the objects in the layer (point, line,
or area) and their current visual propeties. For example, in Figure 1 the
layer "Cities" consists of point objects, the layer "Roads" - of linear
objects, and the layer "Counties" - of areal objects.</li>

<li>
The name of the layer.</li>
</ul>
When visualisation of thematic data is added to a map, the legend item
of the corresponding map layer is extended to include the explanation of
the symbols used for the visualisation.
<p>Through the legend it is possible to do following interactive operations:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>switch on/off drawing of a layer</td>

<td>click on the "minus" or "plus" icon</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>change the active layer</td>

<td>click on the legend item of the layer that should become active (but
not on the "plus" icon)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>change the order of drawing of the layers</td>

<td>drag the legend items to the desired positions. Note that layers shown
at the bottom of the legend are drawn first, and the layers at the top
are drawn last</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>change the visual properties of a layer</td>

<td>double-click on the corresponding legend item. A dialog for editing
of the visual properties will appear on the screen.</td>
</tr>
</table>
