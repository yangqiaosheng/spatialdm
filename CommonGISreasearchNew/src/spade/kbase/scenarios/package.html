This package contains classes for reading of the knowledge base on task support.
The knowledge base is stored in the XML format. All classes of the package
except for KBReader correspond to elements of the DTD file defining the syntax
of the XML file with the knowledge base. The class KBReader reads the knowledge
base into internal structures (instances of the classes representing the
elements)
