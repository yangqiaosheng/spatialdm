Dear students,

as to be seen on our website the deadline is the 5th of August. This
means at this date your program must be sent to me. After that I will go
through the code and evaluate it. In case everything is ok, you will
present your program and tell about what you did and why in about two
weeks later (at the 20th of August). This must be only a short
presentation one or two slides are enough. Please be sure that your
program works, if not the task is not solved and you fail the lab.
Please do not sent me programs that are obviously copied - this is fraud
(But I am sure you will not do so :)).
For a validation of your programs you can use the attached files. The
files contain a solved clustering task for the data set
"berlin_sample.csv". The parameters are: epsilon=300 meters and min
neighbour=30. Your programs must all get to the same results (if you
start your clustering with the very first data point). For those who
solve the sampling based DBScan, the number of Epsilon Neighbourhood
Queries must be significant smaller than: 3850
For those who do the incremental clustering, separate the data set into
two disjoint sets and apply the first clustering to one set and than the
incremental clustering to the remaining. This should lead to the same
results as the ones attached.

Best regards,
Christian

Attachmends:
berlin_sample.csv - the data points to be clustered including an id
berling_sample_clustering.csv - the id of the data points and the
corresponding cluster label, cluster labels in this case 1 to 7 and
empty for noise
