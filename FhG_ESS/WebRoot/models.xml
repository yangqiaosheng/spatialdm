		  This is a model of the standard traffic depending on time of the day and day of the week.
		  It predicts how many cars will be in each place by 15-min time intervals within a given time period.
		  The data have been obtained by aggregating GPS tracks of cars and scaling by factor 50
		  (i.e. the sample of the tracked cars is estimated as 2% of the total number of cars in the city).

			The traffic from the stadium area to the north has been reduced by reducing the weights of the corresponding network links.
			The resulting movement takes less time than with more intensive movement to the north.
